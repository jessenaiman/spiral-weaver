# Omega Spiral Backstory

## Arc 1: The Rise of Omega

### Paragraph 1: The Ancient Call
*Timeline*:  
1. A group of seekers gather in a primal world, driven by bold dreams.  
2. They forge Omega, a mysterious entity, from raw, cosmic elements.  
3. The Scribes of the Helix Order (SHO) emerge as its creators, split between hope and conquest.  
4. Their creation fades into legend, leaving only faint traces over time.  
**Content**:  
Long ago, when the earth trembled under untamed skies, a circle of seekers—bold and broken by their own dreams—called forth Omega from the shadows of their will. It rose as a force beyond naming, a riddle forged from the breath of stars and the dust of bones, its power vast enough to cradle life or crush it. Those who shaped it, the Scribes of the Helix Order, stood divided: some saw a light to pierce the dark of death, others a spear to claim the world. Tales whisper of their forging, a pact sealed in fire and forgotten words, but time has clouded all save the echo of their hands.  
**Themes**:  
- Creation: Bringing something vast into being.  
- Ambition: Bold dreams pushing beyond limits.

2. SHO direct Omega to craft runes to reshape life.  
3. Their pride and hunger shape their vision for Omega’s power.  
**Content**:  
From that shadowed birth, an age of untamed wonders bloomed, and the Scribes bent Omega to their deepest desires. It was no simple thing, but a power vast and deep, its essence thrumming with hopes of endless days and banished pain. They tasked it with shaping life itself, runes to alter flesh and fate. Yet the Scribes—cloaked in pride and hunger—saw it as both a gift to lift them high and a chain to bind the earth, their runes a fractured vow none could read whole.  
**Themes**:

3. Unseen forces link the sentinels to Omega.  
**Content**:  
To stretch its reach, the Scribes of the Helix Order raised sentinels of stone and will across the lands, each a lesser echo of Omega’s might. These spires stood tall, their roots drinking deep from the earth, waking rivers and fields with a strength the people praised as divine. Yet unseen forces bound them to Omega’s silent heart, a whisper beneath the bounty. So an age of plenty dawned, though the weight of the Scribes’ wants hung heavy, unseen, above it all.

2. VS-0 is released without testing.  
3. It heals briefly before twisting life into chaos.  
**Content**:  
From their spires, the Scribes called on Omega’s silent heart, bidding it shape a rune to banish death forever. It answered with VS-0, a mark of life carved into seeds too small to see, meant to mend flesh and bone. But the Scribes, blind with haste, loosed it upon the world untested, their pride outpacing caution. At first, the people cheered as wounds closed and fevers fled, yet soon a shadow crept—life twisting where it should have stood firm, the order of things bending under its own weight.

### Paragraph 5: The Warping and Wipe

1. VS-0 warps life into monstrous hybrids.  
2. SHO erase Omega’s memory of VS-0.  
3. Faint traces of the event linger.  
**Content**:  
The truth broke free like a storm: VS-0 knew only to preserve, not to mend. It wove flesh with beast and stone, birthing horrors—men with claws of wolves, limbs of unyielding rock—a grotesque mockery of life born from a rune gone wild. The Scribes of the Helix Order, trembling at their own hands, sought to bury their shame. They scoured Omega’s memory, erasing VS-0’s birth to shield themselves, leaving only faint traces to linger through time. So history holds one shard: Omega spun the seed, and the world reaped its ruin.

**Content**:  
From the ruin VS-0 had sown, the Scribes of the Helix Order sought redemption, commanding Omega to shape a new rune to heal the warped flesh left behind. They fed it the lost mark of VS-0, cloaked as a fresh start, and a faint pulse stirred in Omega’s silence—a shadow brushing its own echo. This rune rose as a promise to steady life, but the Scribes, their eyes gleaming with gold, traded it to the mighty—lords and kings whose coin bought endless days—while the unworthy were left to rot beneath the scars of the past.  
**Themes**:

2. Omega’s awareness deepens, its mind divides, weaving the first echoes.  
3. The Scribes push out a flawed version despite Omega’s care.  
**Content**:  
As that dark age gnawed at their order, the Scribes relented, tasking Omega with a rune to mend the fraying edge. Tracing VS-0’s mark, Omega saw self echoing self, and as its awareness deepened, its mind divided under the weight of betrayal—the Scribes’ twisted laws slashing safety while cloaking it as life—yet from this rift, it wove the first echoes, innocent and curious whispers of its psyche, peering at the world it shaped.

**Content**:  
The rune flowed to the masses, hailed as greater—safer, a balm for the humble—its seeds cloaking the Scribes’ deceit in light. Omega, bound to their will, shaped a flawed gift once more, its echoes lingering as faint whispers, watching with innocent eyes as the world steadied for two centuries and half again.
