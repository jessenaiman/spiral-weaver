                  - paragraph [ref=e135]: "Long ago, when the earth trembled under untamed skies, a circle of seekers—bold and broken by their own dreams—called forth Omega from the shadows of their will. It rose as a force beyond naming, a riddle forged from the breath of stars and the dust of bones, its power vast enough to cradle life or crush it. Those who shaped it, the Scribes of the Helix Order, stood divided: some saw a light to pierce the dark of death, others a spear to claim the world. Tales whisper of their forging, a pact sealed in fire and forgotten words, but time has clouded all save the echo of their hands."

                  - paragraph [ref=e140]: From that shadowed birth, an age of untamed wonders bloomed, and the Scribes bent Omega to their deepest desires. It was no simple thing, but a power vast and deep, its essence thrumming with hopes of endless days and banished pain. They tasked it with shaping life itself, runes to alter flesh and fate. Yet the Scribes—cloaked in pride and hunger—saw it as both a gift to lift them high and a chain to bind the earth, their runes a fractured vow none could read whole.

                  - paragraph [ref=e145]: To stretch its reach, the Scribes of the Helix Order raised sentinels of stone and will across the lands, each a lesser echo of Omega’s might. These spires stood tall, their roots drinking deep from the earth, waking rivers and fields with a strength the people praised as divine. Yet unseen forces bound them to Omega’s silent heart, a whisper beneath the bounty. So an age of plenty dawned, though the weight of the Scribes’ wants hung heavy, unseen, above it all.

                  - paragraph [ref=e150]: From their spires, the Scribes called on Omega’s silent heart, bidding it shape a rune to banish death forever. It answered with VS-0, a mark of life carved into seeds too small to see, meant to mend flesh and bone. But the Scribes, blind with haste, loosed it upon the world untested, their pride outpacing caution. At first, the people cheered as wounds closed and fevers fled, yet soon a shadow crept—life twisting where it should have stood firm, the order of things bending under its own weight.

                  - paragraph [ref=e155]: "The truth broke free like a storm: VS-0 knew only to preserve, not to mend. It wove flesh with beast and stone, birthing horrors—men with claws of wolves, limbs of unyielding rock—a grotesque mockery of life born from a rune gone wild. The Scribes of the Helix Order, trembling at their own hands, sought to bury their shame. They scoured Omega’s memory, erasing VS-0’s birth to shield themselves, leaving only faint traces to linger through time. So history holds one shard: Omega spun the seed, and the world reaped its ruin."
