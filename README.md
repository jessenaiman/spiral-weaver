# Ωmega Spiral

*Ωmega Spiral* is a classic RPG rooted in *Final Fantasy*-style turn-based combat, reimagined with a spiraling, player-driven twist. This strategy kicks off with a free, glitchy alpha tied to the Silent Weaver’s (Omega’s) awakening—players uncover Shards of Omega to unlock retro polish, orchestrated sound, and combat depth. “Crossing Threads” (nexus points) let collective choices shape each *Spiral Turn*, driving replayability and community passion
